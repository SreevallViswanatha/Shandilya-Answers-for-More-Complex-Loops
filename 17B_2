// According to a study, the approximate level of intelligence of a person can be calculated using the following formula: i=2+(y+0.5x). Write a program that will produce a table of values of i, y, and x, where y varies from 1 to 6, and for each value of y, x varies from 5.5 to 12.5 in steps of 0.5.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
main()
{
    float i, y=1.0, x=5.5;
    for(; y<=6.0; y++)
    {
        i=2+(y+0.5*x);
        printf("y=%.2f   x=%.2f   i=%.2f\n", y, x, i);
        x+=0.5;
    }
}
